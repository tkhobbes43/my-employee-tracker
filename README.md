<h1 align="center"> My Employee Tracker </h1>



## Description
I want to create a content management system (CMS) that non-developers can use to easily view and interact with the information that is stored in databases.  This app will use the command-line to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.

## User Story
```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
```

## Installation
This will require Node.js as well as npm packages Inquirer, MySQL2, and console.table.  Inquirer to so that user can interact using the command line.  MySQL2 to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries. Console.table to print MySQL rows to the console.

## Usage
Use inquirer from the command line to view or add to the database.  Please see the below video walkthrough.
